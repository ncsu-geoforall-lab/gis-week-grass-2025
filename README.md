# Getting Started in GRASS with Python, Pixels, and Pigs

Anna Petrasova, Vaclav Petras, Caitlin Haedrich 

In this hands-on workshop, we’ll take our first steps in GRASS by exploring a small watershed
in Eastern North Carolina—home to some of the highest densities of swine waste lagoons in the country.
Within an online computational notebook we will model how water — and waste — might move through the landscape.
No prior GRASS experience required, basic Python is an advantage.
