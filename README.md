# Getting Started in GRASS with Python, Pixels, and Pigs

Anna Petrasova, Vaclav Petras, Caitlin Haedrich 

In this hands-on workshop, we’ll take our first steps in GRASS by exploring a small watershed
in Eastern North Carolina—home to some of the highest densities of swine waste lagoons in the country.
Within an online computational notebook we will model how water — and waste — might move through the landscape.
No prior GRASS experience required, basic Python is an advantage.

## Workshop Outline

### 1. Building Geospatial Models in GRASS
#### 1.1 GRASS + Jupyter introduction
1. What is [GRASS](https://grass.osgeo.org/)? Learn about various [ways to interact with GRASS](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-devel/manuals/interfaces_overview.html).
2. To learn how to get started with GRASS in Google Colab, go to the [Learn GRASS](https://grass-tutorials.osgeo.org/) website and open the [Get started with GRASS in Google Colab](https://grass-tutorials.osgeo.org/).
3. To learn how to visualize data in a notebook, go to [GRASS Jupyter introduction](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-devel/manuals/jupyter_intro.html)  in documentation.
3. To learn how to run GRASS tools in a notebook, go to [GRASS Python API  documentation](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-devel/manuals/python_intro.html).


#### 1.2 Hands-on exercise

Open the workshop.ipynb in Google Colab and execute the cells one by one:

Aletrnatively, try running the notebook through mybinder.org:

#### 1.3 Developing your own models

In this part, you will develop simple geospatial models that will be run on Tangible Landscape in the second part of the workshop.

Use the suggested tasks, together with [GRASS documentation](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-devel/manuals/index.html) and provided template in the notebook
to (1) develop the models, (2) test them, and (3) visualize the results.
This model will then run on Tangible Landscape.
